# üß† Diabetes Prediction with Explainable Machine Learning

This project builds a diabetes risk prediction model using structured health data and explains the model‚Äôs predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). It uses XGBoost for classification and SHAP for model interpretability.

## üéØ Objective

- Predict the likelihood of diabetes using health metrics
- Use XGBoost for high-accuracy classification
- Explain model behavior using SHAP visualizations

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Records**: 768
- **Features**: Age, Glucose, BMI, Insulin, etc.
- **Target**: 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib

## üìà Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Replaced 0s with NaN and filled using median.
2. **EDA**: Plotted distributions and feature correlation.
3. **Modeling**: Trained XGBoost classifier with 76% accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Used confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Explainability**: Visualized SHAP values to explain predictions.

## üîç SHAP Output

- **Glucose**, **BMI**, and **Age** were top predictors.
- SHAP beeswarm plot shows how each feature influenced predictions.
